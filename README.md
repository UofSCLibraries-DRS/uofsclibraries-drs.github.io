# USC Libraries Lab Notebooks

Welcome to the **University of South Carolina Libraries Data Services Lab Notebooks** repository!
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and tutorials designed to help researchers and students learn data wrangling, visualization, text analysis, and more using Python and R. These resources aim to lower technological barriers by offering beginner-friendly, hands-on examples in an accessible and reproducible format.

## What's Inside

You'll find curated notebooks organized into topics like:

* **Data Wrangling with Python and R**
* **Data Extraction with APIs**
* **Text Mining & NLP (Named Entity Recognition, etc.)**
* **Data Visualization**
* **Machine Learning**

Each notebook includes:

* Annotated code
* Contextual explanations
* Interactive elements
* Links to tools and platforms

## How to Use or Download

To explore or run a notebook:

### Option 1: Download the code

* Navigate to any page with code.
* Use the **“Download”** button in the upper right-hand corner to get the `.ipynb` file.

### Option 2: Clone the repo

If you're familiar with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uofsclibraries-drs/uofsclibraries-drs.github.io.git
```

Then open the notebooks using **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or **VSCode**.

## Requirements

Some notebooks require Python libraries like:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `spacy`
* `requests`

R notebooks use base R and packages such as `tidyverse`. Installation instructions are usually noted at the top of each notebook.
