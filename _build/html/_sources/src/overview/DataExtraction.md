# Brief Overview
Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from sources like websites, databases, or APIs. A key step in this process is data cleaning, which involves removing duplicates, fixing errors, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure the data is accurate and usable. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow for structured data to be accessed programmatically from external services, often in formats like JSON or XML. While API data is typically well-organized, it may still require cleaning to match specific analysis needs. Together, data cleaning and API use help ensure that extracted data is reliable and ready for analysis.
