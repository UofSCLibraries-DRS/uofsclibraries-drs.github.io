# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the practice of representing data graphically to better understand trends, patterns, and insights. The University of South Carolina Libraries offer a variety of data visualization resources, including guides on visualization tools and techniques, and help with selecting the most effective methods for specific needs. Students, faculty, and staff can access consultations, attend workshops, and use the DataLab space on the 5th floor of Thomas Cooper Library. These resources support learning and application of tools such as Excel, Tableau, and R for effective data analysis and presentation.

## Matplotlib
Bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots are common tools for visualizing data. Bar charts compare values across categories using rectangular bars, making them ideal for categorical data. Line charts show trends over time by connecting data points, useful for tracking changes in continuous data. Scatter plots display the relationship between two numerical variables, helping to identify correlations, patterns, and outliers.

## Plotly
This guide explains how to create maps using Python, focusing on **choropleth maps** and **proportional dot maps**, with data from a CSV file on COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. It introduces maps as visual tools for representing physical and human-made geographic features, as well as thematic data like population or climate. It also covers **spatial data formats** (e.g., GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML, CSV) and the role of **GIS systems** in analyzing and visualizing geographic data. The guide assumes you're using **Anaconda** but provides a link to Pythonâ€™s package installation guide if you're not.

## Seaborn
This section introduces **Seaborn**, a Python library for creating statistical visualizations. Built on **matplotlib** and integrated with **pandas**, Seaborn makes it easy to explore and visualize relationships in data with minimal code. It provides smart defaults, customizable features, and is well-suited for both quick exploration and presentation-ready plots.
