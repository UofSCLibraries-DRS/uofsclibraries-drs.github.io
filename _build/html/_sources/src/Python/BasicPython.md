# Basic Python Tutorials
These five basic Python tutorials teach the fundamentals of Python programming, starting with operators, expressions, data types, and variables. They then cover flow control (like if-else statements and loops), data structures such as lists and dictionaries, and how to write and use your own functions. The series concludes with an introduction to working with strings and using popular Python packagesâ€”equipping learners with the essential tools to begin text analysis in Python.
