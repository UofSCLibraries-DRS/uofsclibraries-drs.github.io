# Intermediate Python Tutorials
These intermediate Python tutorials build on the basics by introducing more advanced concepts and tools. They cover comprehensions for lists, dictionaries, and sets; working with different file types (like .txt, .csv, .json); using the pathlib library for file manipulation; and the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including how to define and use classes. The series concludes with an explanation of generators, their syntax, and the benefits of using them for efficient data processing.
