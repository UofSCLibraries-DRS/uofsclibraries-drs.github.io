# Advanced Text Analysis
These notebooks cover various foundational techniques in text analysis. One notebook introduces sentiment analysis using VADER and Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers to classify text sentiment. Another explains tokenization, covering concepts like word segmentation, n-grams, stemming, and lemmatization. Two notebooks demonstrate how to process plain text files and metadata into a JSON-L format containing unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and full text. The final notebook focuses on topic modeling, including dataset retrieval, token cleaning, and topic visualization using Gensim and pyLDAvis.
