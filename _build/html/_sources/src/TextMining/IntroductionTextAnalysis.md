# Introduction to Text Analysis
Text analysis, or text mining, is the process of extracting meaningful information from written or spoken language using computational methods. It combines techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical analysis to identify patterns and insights within large collections of text. Key tools and methods in text analysis include creating concordances and identifying collocations, developing and modifying stopwords lists, and determining the most common words in a dataset. These foundational steps help uncover trends and relationships in text, supporting deeper understanding and informed decision-making across various fields.
