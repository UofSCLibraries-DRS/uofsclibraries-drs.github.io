    "## Laying Out the Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is a **unit converter app** that allows users to convert between different units in four categories: **Length, Weight, Cooking, and Temperature**. The app follows a **separate frontend and backend architecture**, which brings several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Separation of Concerns**: By keeping the frontend and backend independent, each part can be developed, tested, and updated separately without breaking the other.\n",
    "* **Scalability**: This structure allows for easier scaling in the future. For example, if we want to expand the app to other platforms (web, desktop), we can reuse the backend without major changes.\n",
    "* **Flexibility**: Different technologies can be used for each part, allowing us to choose the best tools for each job.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **backend**, we chose **Python with FastAPI**. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. It is known for its simplicity, excellent performance, and automatic generation of API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **frontend**, we used **React Native with Expo**, which enables us to build native mobile applications for both Android and iOS using JavaScript and React. Expo simplifies the development process with pre-built tools and services, making it easier to test and deploy apps quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll dive deeper into both the backend and frontend setups later in this tutorial, but this framework gives us a strong, modular foundation to build a reliable, flexible, and user-friendly app.\n"

    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we’ll set up the project structure and version control using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a GitHub Repository**\n",
    "   Start by creating a new repository on GitHub called `unit_converter`. This will help track your project’s progress and make collaboration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clone the Repository Locally**\n",
    "   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unit_converter.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Backend Folder**\n",
    "   Inside the cloned repository, create a folder called `backend`. This folder will contain all the backend code for your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd unit_converter\n",
    "   mkdir backend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This clean project structure keeps your backend organized and allows you to build the frontend separately. We’ll add the backend files and set up the FastAPI server in the next steps."

    "## Building the Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend for our unit converter app is built using **Python** and the **FastAPI** framework. The backend is responsible for performing the actual unit conversion calculations based on requests from the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why FastAPI?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose FastAPI for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks, thanks to its asynchronous support and use of Python’s `async` features.\n",
    "* **Easy to Learn and Use**: FastAPI has a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it accessible, even for developers new to building APIs.\n",
    "* **Automatic API Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API docs using Swagger UI and ReDoc, which helps with testing and development.\n",
    "* **Built-in Data Validation**: FastAPI uses Python type hints and the powerful Pydantic library for validating request data, making the code more robust and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Backend Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "While FastAPI is a great choice for this project, there are other popular frameworks for building backends, depending on your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flask (Python)**: A lightweight framework that's easy to get started with but lacks some features like built-in data validation and async support.\n",
    "* **Django (Python)**: A full-featured framework with built-in admin tools, ideal for larger, more complex projects but potentially overkill for a simple API like this.\n",
    "* **Express.js (JavaScript/Node.js)**: A popular backend framework for JavaScript developers, especially useful if you prefer to keep both frontend and backend in the same language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, FastAPI strikes the right balance between simplicity, performance, and ease of use, making it ideal for building a reliable, efficient API for our mobile app.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we’ll walk through setting up FastAPI and writing the conversion logic.\n"
