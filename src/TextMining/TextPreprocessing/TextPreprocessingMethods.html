<p>This code block sets up the tools needed for basic text processing and analysis. It imports the NLTK library for natural language processing, Python’s built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code> module for handling punctuation, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib.pyplot</span></code> for creating visualizations. It also downloads two essential NLTK resources: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">punkt_tab</span></code> for advanced word tokenization and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stopwords</span></code> for filtering out common words that usually don’t carry meaningful information. Finally, it imports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word_tokenize</span></code> to split text into individual words and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FreqDist</span></code> to calculate the frequency of those words for further analysis or visualization.</p>

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.lower()</span></code> to make text uniform<a class="headerlink" href="#using-lower-to-make-text-uniform" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code is using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.lower()</span></code> to convert all characters in the text to lowercase, which is a common step in text preprocessing to ensure consistency (so that words like “This” and “this” are treated the same). Similarly, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.upper()</span></code> method converts all characters to uppercase. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(text)</span></code> outputs the lowercase version of the text.</p>

<p>This code defines a function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read_book(title)</span></code> that reads the full contents of a text file and returns it as a single cleaned-up string.</p>
<p>Inside the function, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">open(...)</span></code> statement opens the file specified by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code> in read mode with UTF-8 encoding, ensuring it can handle most characters properly. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read()</span></code> method loads the entire file content from the start of the play to the end of the play into the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code>.  Line breaks (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\n</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\r</span></code>) are replaced with spaces to flatten the structure. It also uses a regular expression to replace any sequence of multiple whitespace characters with a single space, ensuring consistent spacing. Then, it trims any leading or trailing whitespace and returns the cleaned text, making it ready for further processing like tokenization or analysis.</p>
<p>After defining the function, the line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">read_book(&quot;RomeoAndJuliet.txt&quot;)</span></code> calls it to load the contents of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. The following line, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">text.lower()</span></code>, converts the entire text to lowercase. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(text)</span></code> displays the cleaned, lowercase version of the text.</p>

a madness most discreet, a choking gall, and a preserving sweet. farewell, my coz. ben. soft! i will go along. an if you leave me so, you do me wrong. rom. tut! i have lost myself; i am not here: this is not romeo, he&#39;s some other where. ben. tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

rom. she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; for beauty, starv&#39;d with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity. she is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, to merit bliss by making me despair. she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now. ben. be rul&#39;d by me: forget to think of her. rom. o, teach me how i should forget to think! ben. by giving liberty unto thine eyes. examine other beauties. rom. &#39;tis the way to call hers (exquisite) in question more. these happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#39; brows, being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost. show me a mistress that is passing fair, what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass&#39;d that passing fair?

young son, it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. care keeps his watch in every old man&#39;s eye, and where care lodges sleep will never lie; but where unbruised youth with unstuff&#39;d brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous&#39;d with some distemp&#39;rature; or if not so, then here i hit it right- our romeo hath not been in bed to-night. rom. that last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. friar. god pardon sin! wast thou with rosaline? rom. with rosaline, my ghostly father? no. i have forgot that name, and that name&#39;s woe. friar. that&#39;s my good son! but where hast thou been then? rom. i&#39;ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me that&#39;s by me wounded. both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies. i bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, my intercession likewise steads my foe. friar. be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. rom. then plainly know my heart&#39;s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet; as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, and all combin&#39;d, save what thou must combine by holy marriage. when, and where, and how we met, we woo&#39;d, and made exchange of vow, i&#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this i pray, that thou consent to marry us to-day. friar. holy saint francis! what a change is here! is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken? young men&#39;s love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. jesu maria! what a deal of brine hath wash&#39;d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline! how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste! the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash&#39;d off yet. if e&#39;er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline. and art thou chang&#39;d? pronounce this sentence then: women may fall when there&#39;s no strength in men. rom. thou chid&#39;st me oft for loving rosaline. friar. for doting, not for loving, pupil mine. rom. and bad&#39;st me bury love. friar. not in a grave to lay one in, another out to have. rom. i pray thee chide not. she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow. the other did not so. friar. o, she knew well thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. but come, young waverer, come go with me. in one respect i&#39;ll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households&#39; rancour to pure love. rom. o, let us hence! i stand on sudden haste. friar. wisely, and slow. they stumble that run fast. exeunt. scene iv. a street. enter benvolio and mercutio. mer. where the devil should this romeo be? came he not home to-night? ben. not to his father&#39;s. i spoke with his man. mer. why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad. ben. tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father&#39;s house. mer. a challenge, on my life. ben. romeo will answer it. mer. any man that can write may answer a letter. ben. nay, he will answer the letter&#39;s master, how he dares, being dared. mer. alas, poor romeo, he is already dead! stabb&#39;d with a white wench&#39;s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy&#39;s butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter tybalt? ben. why, what is tybalt? mer. more than prince of cats, i can tell you. o, he&#39;s the courageous captain of compliments. he fights as you sing pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay. ben. the what? mer. the pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these new tuners of accent! &#39;by jesu, a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good whore!&#39; why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi&#39;s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? o, their bones, their bones! enter romeo. ben. here comes romeo! here comes romeo! mer. without his roe, like a dried herring. o flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in. laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love to berhyme her), dido a dowdy, cleopatra a gypsy, helen and hero hildings and harlots, this be a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose. signior romeo, bon jour! there&#39;s a french salutation to your french slop. you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night. rom. good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you? mer. the slip, sir, the slip. can you not conceive? rom. pardon, good mercutio. my business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. mer. that&#39;s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams. rom. meaning, to cursy. mer. thou hast most kindly hit it. rom. a most courteous exposition. mer. nay, i am the very pink of courtesy. rom. pink for flower. mer. right. rom. why, then is my pump well-flower&#39;d. mer. well said! follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular. rom. o single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness! mer. come between us, good benvolio! my wits faint. rom. swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or i&#39;ll cry a match. mer. nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, i am sure, i have in my whole five. was i with you there for the goose? rom. thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose. mer. i will bite thee by the ear for that jest. rom. nay, good goose, bite not! mer. thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. rom. and is it not, then, well serv&#39;d in to a sweet goose? mer. o, here&#39;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad! rom. i stretch it out for that word &#39;broad,&#39; which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. mer. why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. ben. stop there, stop there! mer. thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. ben. thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. mer. o, thou art deceiv&#39;d! i would have made it short; for i was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer. rom. here&#39;s goodly gear! enter nurse and her man [peter]. mer. a sail, a sail! ben. two, two! a shirt and a smock. nurse. peter! peter. anon. nurse. my fan, peter. mer. good peter, to hide her face; for her fan&#39;s the fairer face of the two. nurse. god ye good morrow, gentlemen. mer. god ye good-den, fair gentlewoman. nurse. is it good-den?

ben. tybalt, here slain, whom romeo&#39;s hand did stay. romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was, and urg&#39;d withal your high displeasure. all this- uttered with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow&#39;d- could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio&#39;s breast; who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt, whose dexterity retorts it. romeo he cries aloud, &#39;hold, friends! friends, part!&#39; and swifter than his tongue, his agile arm beats down their fatal points, and &#39;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled; but by-and-by comes back to romeo, who had but newly entertain&#39;d revenge, and to&#39;t they go like lightning; for, ere i could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain; and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly. this is the truth, or let benvolio die. cap. wife. he is a kinsman to the montague; affection makes him false, he speaks not true. some twenty of them fought in this black strife, and all those twenty could but kill one life. i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give. romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live. prince. romeo slew him; he slew mercutio. who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? mon. not romeo, prince; he was mercutio&#39;s friend; his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of tybalt. prince. and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence. i have an interest in your hate&#39;s proceeding, my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; but i&#39;ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine. i will be deaf to pleading and excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. therefore use none. let romeo hence in haste, else, when he is found, that hour is his last. bear hence this body, and attend our will. mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. exeunt. scene ii. capulet&#39;s orchard. enter juliet alone. jul. gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards phoebus&#39; lodging! such a wagoner as phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately. spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway eyes may wink, and romeo leap to these arms untalk&#39;d of and unseen. lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties; or, if love be blind, it best agrees with night. come, civil night, thou sober-suited matron, all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match, play&#39;d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. hood my unmann&#39;d blood, bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, think true love acted simple modesty. come, night; come, romeo; come, thou day in night; for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven&#39;s back. come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow&#39;d night; give me my romeo; and, when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. o, i have bought the mansion of a love, but not possess&#39;d it; and though i am sold, not yet enjoy&#39;d. so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse, enter nurse, with cords. and she brings news; and every tongue that speaks but romeo&#39;s name speaks heavenly eloquence. now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there? the cords that romeo bid thee fetch? nurse. ay, ay, the cords. [throws them down.] jul. ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands nurse. ah, weraday! he&#39;s dead, he&#39;s dead, he&#39;s dead! we are undone, lady, we are undone! alack the day! he&#39;s gone, he&#39;s kill&#39;d, he&#39;s dead! jul. can heaven be so envious? nurse. romeo can, though heaven cannot. o romeo, romeo! who ever would have thought it? romeo! jul. what devil art thou that dost torment me thus? this torture should be roar&#39;d in dismal hell. hath romeo slain himself? say thou but &#39;i,&#39; and that bare vowel &#39;i&#39; shall poison more than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. i am not i, if there be such an &#39;i&#39;; or those eyes shut that make thee answer &#39;i.&#39; if be be slain, say &#39;i&#39;; or if not, &#39;no.&#39; brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. nurse. i saw the wound, i saw it with mine eyes, (god save the mark!) here on his manly breast. a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub&#39;d in blood, all in gore-blood. i swounded at the sight. jul. o, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once! to prison, eyes; ne&#39;er look on liberty! vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here, and thou and romeo press one heavy bier! nurse. o tybalt, tybalt, the best friend i had! o courteous tybalt! honest gentleman that ever i should live to see thee dead! jul. what storm is this that blows so contrary? is romeo slaught&#39;red, and is tybalt dead? my dear-lov&#39;d cousin, and my dearer lord? then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! for who is living, if those two are gone? nurse. tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; romeo that kill&#39;d him, he is banished. jul. o god! did romeo&#39;s hand shed tybalt&#39;s blood? nurse. it did, it did! alas the day, it did! jul. o serpent heart, hid with a flow&#39;ring face! did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! dove-feather&#39;d raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! despised substance of divinest show! just opposite to what thou justly seem&#39;st- a damned saint, an honourable villain! o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace! nurse. there&#39;s no trust, no faith, no honesty in men; all perjur&#39;d, all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. ah, where&#39;s my man? give me some aqua vitae. these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. shame come to romeo! jul. blister&#39;d be thy tongue for such a wish! he was not born to shame. upon his brow shame is asham&#39;d to sit; for &#39;tis a throne where honour may be crown&#39;d sole monarch of the universal earth. o, what a beast was i to chide at him! nurse. will you speak well of him that kill&#39;d your cousin? jul. shall i speak ill of him that is my husband? ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name when i, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? but wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? that villain cousin would have kill&#39;d my husband. back, foolish tears, back to your native spring! your tributary drops belong to woe, which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain; and tybalt&#39;s dead, that would have slain my husband. all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then? some word there was, worser than tybalt&#39;s death, that murd&#39;red me. i would forget it fain; but o, it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners&#39; minds! &#39;tybalt is dead, and romeo- banished.&#39; that &#39;banished,&#39; that one word &#39;banished,&#39; hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt&#39;s death was woe enough, if it had ended there; or, if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank&#39;d with other griefs, why followed not, when she said &#39;tybalt&#39;s dead,&#39; thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, which modern lamentation might have mov&#39;d? but with a rearward following tybalt&#39;s death, &#39;romeo is banished&#39;- to speak that word is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, all slain, all dead. &#39;romeo is banished&#39;- there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word&#39;s death; no words can that woe sound. where is my father and my mother, nurse? nurse. weeping and wailing over tybalt&#39;s corse. will you go to them? i will bring you thither. jul. wash they his wounds with tears? mine shall be spent, when theirs are dry, for romeo&#39;s banishment. take up those cords. poor ropes, you are beguil&#39;d, both you and i, for romeo is exil&#39;d. he made you for a highway to my bed; but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed. come, cords; come, nurse. i&#39;ll to my wedding bed; and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead! nurse. hie to your chamber. i&#39;ll find romeo to comfort you. i wot well where he is. hark ye, your romeo will be here at night. i&#39;ll to him; he is hid at laurence&#39; cell. jul. o, find him! give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell. exeunt. scene iii. friar laurence&#39;s cell. enter friar [laurence]. friar. romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. affliction is enanmour&#39;d of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. enter romeo. rom. father, what news? what is the prince&#39;s doom what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not? friar. too familiar is my dear son with such sour company. i bring thee tidings of the prince&#39;s doom. rom. what less than doomsday is the prince&#39;s doom? friar. a gentler judgment vanish&#39;d from his lips- not body&#39;s death, but body&#39;s banishment. rom. ha, banishment? be merciful, say &#39;death&#39;; for exile hath more terror in his look, much more than death. do not say &#39;banishment.&#39; friar. hence from verona art thou banished. be patient, for the world is broad and wide. rom. there is no world without verona walls, but purgatory, torture, hell itself. hence banished is banish&#39;d from the world, and world&#39;s exile is death. then &#39;banishment&#39; is death misterm&#39;d. calling death &#39;banishment,&#39; thou cut&#39;st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me. friar. o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness! thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, taking thy part, hath rush&#39;d aside the law, and turn&#39;d that black word death to banishment. this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. rom. &#39;tis torture, and not mercy. heaven is here, where juliet lives; and every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her; but romeo may not. more validity, more honourable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet&#39;s hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips, who, even in pure and vestal modesty, still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; but romeo may not- he is banished. this may flies do, when i from this must fly; they are free men, but i am banished. and sayest thou yet that exile is not death? hadst thou no poison mix&#39;d, no sharp-ground knife, no sudden mean of death, though ne&#39;er so mean, but &#39;banished&#39; to kill me- &#39;banished&#39;? o friar, the damned use that word in hell; howling attends it! how hast thou the heart, being a divine, a ghostly confessor, a sin-absolver, and my friend profess&#39;d, to mangle me with that word &#39;banished&#39;? friar. thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak. rom. o, thou wilt speak again of banishment. friar. i&#39;ll give thee armour to keep off that word; adversity&#39;s sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, though thou art banished. rom. yet &#39;banished&#39;? hang up philosophy! unless philosophy can make a juliet, displant a town, reverse a prince&#39;s doom, it helps not, it prevails not. talk no more. friar. o, then i see that madmen have no ears. rom. how should they, when that wise men have no eyes? friar. let me dispute with thee of thy estate. rom. thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, an hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me, and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, and fall upon the ground, as i do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave. knock [within]. friar. arise; one knocks. good romeo, hide thyself. rom. not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans, mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. knock. friar. hark, how they knock! who&#39;s there? romeo, arise; thou wilt be taken.- stay awhile!- stand up; knock. run to my study.- by-and-by!- god&#39;s will, what simpleness is this.- i come, i come! knock. who knocks so hard? whence come you? what&#39;s your will nurse.

2. mus. hang him, jack! come, we&#39;ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner. exeunt. act v. scene i. mantua. a street. enter romeo. rom. if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand. my bosom&#39;s lord sits lightly in his throne, and all this day an unaccustom&#39;d spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. i dreamt my lady came and found me dead (strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!) and breath&#39;d such life with kisses in my lips that i reviv&#39;d and was an emperor. ah me! how sweet is love itself possess&#39;d, when but love&#39;s shadows are so rich in joy! enter romeo&#39;s man balthasar, booted. news from verona! how now, balthasar? dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? how doth my lady? is my father well? how fares my juliet? that i ask again, for nothing can be ill if she be well. man. then she is well, and nothing can be ill. her body sleeps in capel&#39;s monument, and her immortal part with angels lives. i saw her laid low in her kindred&#39;s vault and presently took post to tell it you. o, pardon me for bringing these ill news, since you did leave it for my office, sir. rom. is it e&#39;en so? then i defy you, stars! thou knowest my lodging. get me ink and paper and hire posthorses. i will hence to-night. man. i do beseech you, sir, have patience. your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure. rom. tush, thou art deceiv&#39;d. leave me and do the thing i bid thee do. hast thou no letters to me from the friar? man. no, my good lord. rom. no matter. get thee gone and hire those horses. i&#39;ll be with thee straight. exit [balthasar]. well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night. let&#39;s see for means. o mischief, thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men! i do remember an apothecary, and hereabouts &#39;a dwells, which late i noted in tatt&#39;red weeds, with overwhelming brows, culling of simples. meagre were his looks, sharp misery had worn him to the bones; and in his needy shop a tortoise hung, an alligator stuff&#39;d, and other skins of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes, green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered, to make up a show. noting this penury, to myself i said, &#39;an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua, here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.&#39; o, this same thought did but forerun my need, and this same needy man must sell it me. as i remember, this should be the house. being holiday, the beggar&#39;s shop is shut. what, ho! apothecary! enter apothecary. apoth. who calls so loud? rom. come hither, man. i see that thou art poor. hold, there is forty ducats. let me have a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life-weary taker mall fall dead, and that the trunk may be discharg&#39;d of breath as violently as hasty powder fir&#39;d doth hurry from the fatal cannon&#39;s womb. apoth. such mortal drugs i have; but mantua&#39;s law is death to any he that utters them. rom. art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die? famine is in thy cheeks, need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back: the world is not thy friend, nor the world&#39;s law; the world affords no law to make thee rich; then be not poor, but break it and take this. apoth. my poverty but not my will consents. rom. i pay thy poverty and not thy will. apoth. put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off, and if you had the strength of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. rom. there is thy gold- worse poison to men&#39;s souls, doing more murther in this loathsome world, than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. farewell. buy food and get thyself in flesh. come, cordial and not poison, go with me to juliet&#39;s grave; for there must i use thee. exeunt. scene ii. verona. friar laurence&#39;s cell. enter friar john to friar laurence. john. holy franciscan friar, brother, ho! enter friar laurence. laur. this same should be the voice of friar john. welcome from mantua. what says romeo? or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. john. going to find a barefoot brother out, one of our order, to associate me here in this city visiting the sick, and finding him, the searchers of the town, suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign, seal&#39;d up the doors, and would not let us forth, so that my speed to mantua there was stay&#39;d. laur. who bare my letter, then, to romeo? john. i could not send it- here it is again- nor get a messenger to bring it thee, so fearful were they of infection. laur. unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, the letter was not nice, but full of charge, of dear import; and the neglecting it may do much danger. friar john, go hence, get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell. john. brother, i&#39;ll go and bring it thee. exit. laur. now, must i to the monument alone. within this three hours will fair juliet wake. she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents; but i will write again to mantua, and keep her at my cell till romeo come- poor living corse, clos&#39;d in a dead man&#39;s tomb! exit. scene iii. verona. a churchyard; in it the monument of the capulets. enter paris and his page with flowers and [a torch]. par. give me thy torch, boy. hence, and stand aloof. yet put it out, for i would not be seen. under yond yew tree lay thee all along, holding thine ear close to the hollow ground. so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread (being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves) but thou shalt hear it. whistle then to me, as signal that thou hear&#39;st something approach. give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go. page. [aside] i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard; yet i will adventure. [retires.] par. sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew (o woe! thy canopy is dust and stones) which with sweet water nightly i will dew; or, wanting that, with tears distill&#39;d by moans. the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep. whistle boy. the boy gives warning something doth approach. what cursed foot wanders this way to-night to cross my obsequies and true love&#39;s rite? what, with a torch? muffle me, night, awhile. [retires.] enter romeo, and balthasar with a torch, a mattock, and a crow of iron. rom. give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. hold, take this letter. early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father. give me the light. upon thy life i charge thee, whate&#39;er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course. why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady&#39;s face, but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring- a ring that i must use in dear employment. therefore hence, be gone. but if thou, jealous, dost return to pry in what i farther shall intend to do, by heaven, i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. the time and my intents are savage-wild, more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea. bal. i will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. rom. so shalt thou show me friendship. take thou that. live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow. bal. [aside] for all this same, i&#39;ll hide me hereabout. his looks i fear, and his intents i doubt. [retires.] rom. thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, gorg&#39;d with the dearest morsel of the earth, thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open, and in despite i&#39;ll cram thee with more food. romeo opens the tomb. par. this is that banish&#39;d haughty montague that murd&#39;red my love&#39;s cousin- with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died- and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies. i will apprehend him. stop thy unhallowed toil, vile montague! can vengeance be pursu&#39;d further than death? condemned villain, i do apprehend thee. obey, and go with me; for thou must die. rom. i must indeed; and therefore came i hither. good gentle youth, tempt not a desp&#39;rate man. fly hence and leave me. think upon these gone; let them affright thee. i beseech thee, youth, but not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury. o, be gone! by heaven, i love thee better than myself, for i come hither arm&#39;d against myself. stay not, be gone. live, and hereafter say a madman&#39;s mercy bid thee run away. par. i do defy thy, conjuration and apprehend thee for a felon here. rom. wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! they fight. page. o lord, they fight! i will go call the watch. [exit. paris falls.] par. o, i am slain! if thou be merciful, open the tomb, lay me with juliet. [dies.] rom. in faith, i will. let me peruse this face. mercutio&#39;s kinsman, noble county paris! what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode? i think he told me paris should have married juliet. said he not so? or did i dream it so? or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so? o, give me thy hand, one writ with me in sour misfortune&#39;s book! i&#39;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. a grave? o, no, a lanthorn, slaught&#39;red youth, for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light. death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr&#39;d. [lays him in the tomb.] how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry! which their keepers call a lightning before death. o, how may i call this a lightning? o my love! my wife! death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. thou art not conquer&#39;d. beauty&#39;s ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, and death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there. tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? o, what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy? forgive me, cousin.&#39; ah, dear juliet, why art thou yet so fair? shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour? for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again. here, here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids. o, here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last! arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death! come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide! thou desperate pilot, now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! here&#39;s to my love! [drinks.] o true apothecary! thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die. falls. enter friar [laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade. friar. saint francis be my speed! how oft to-night have my old feet stumbled at graves! who&#39;s there? bal. here&#39;s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. friar. bliss be upon you! tell me, good my friend, what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern, it burneth in the capels&#39; monument. bal. it doth so, holy sir; and there&#39;s my master, one that you love. friar. who is it? bal. romeo. friar. how long hath he been there? bal. full half an hour. friar. go with me to the vault. bal. i dare not, sir. my master knows not but i am gone hence, and fearfully did menace me with death if i did stay to look on his intents. friar. stay then; i&#39;ll go alone. fear comes upon me. o, much i fear some ill unthrifty thing. bal. as i did sleep under this yew tree here, i dreamt my master and another fought, and that my master slew him. friar. romeo! alack, alack, what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre? what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour&#39;d by this place of peace? [enters the tomb.] romeo! o, pale! who else? what, paris too? and steep&#39;d in blood? ah, what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance! the lady stirs. juliet rises. jul. o comfortable friar! where is my lord? i do remember well where i should be, and there i am. where is my romeo? friar. i hear some noise. lady, come from that nest of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents. come, come away. thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; and paris too. come, i&#39;ll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns. stay not to question, for the watch is coming. come, go, good juliet. i dare no longer stay. jul. go, get thee hence, for i will not away. exit [friar]. what&#39;s here? a cup, clos&#39;d in my true love&#39;s hand? poison, i see, hath been his timeless end. o churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after? i will kiss thy lips. haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative. [kisses him.] thy lips are warm! chief watch. [within] lead, boy. which way? yea, noise? then i&#39;ll be brief. o happy dagger! [snatches romeo&#39;s dagger.] this is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die. she stabs herself and falls [on romeo&#39;s body]. enter [paris&#39;s] boy and watch. boy. this is the place. there, where the torch doth burn. chief watch. &#39;the ground is bloody. search about the churchyard. go, some of you; whoe&#39;er you find attach. [exeunt some of the watch.] pitiful sight! here lies the county slain; and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, who here hath lain this two days buried. go, tell the prince; run to the capulets; raise up the montagues; some others search. [exeunt others of the watch.] we see the ground whereon these woes do lie, but the true ground of all these piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry. enter [some of the watch,] with romeo&#39;s man [balthasar]. 2. watch. here&#39;s romeo&#39;s man. we found him in the churchyard. chief watch. hold him in safety till the prince come hither. enter friar [laurence] and another watchman. 3. watch. here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side. chief watch. a great suspicion! stay the friar too. enter the prince [and attendants]. prince. what misadventure is so early up, that calls our person from our morning rest? enter capulet and his wife [with others]. cap. what should it be, that they so shriek abroad? wife. the people in the street cry &#39;romeo,&#39; some &#39;juliet,&#39; and some &#39;paris&#39;; and all run, with open outcry, toward our monument. prince. what fear is this which startles in our ears? chief watch. sovereign, here lies the county paris slain; and romeo dead; and juliet, dead before, warm and new kill&#39;d. prince. search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. chief watch. here is a friar, and slaughter&#39;d romeo&#39;s man, with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men&#39;s tombs. cap. o heavens! o wife, look how our daughter bleeds! this dagger hath mista&#39;en, for, lo, his house is empty on the back of montague, and it missheathed in my daughter&#39;s bosom! wife. o me! this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre. enter montague [and others]. prince. come, montague; for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down. mon. alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night! grief of my son&#39;s exile hath stopp&#39;d her breath. what further woe conspires against mine age? prince. look, and thou shalt see. mon. o thou untaught! what manners is in this, to press before thy father to a grave? prince. seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring, their head, their true descent; and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death. meantime forbear, and let mischance be slave to patience. bring forth the parties of suspicion. friar. i am the greatest, able to do least, yet most suspected, as the time and place doth make against me, of this direful murther; and here i stand, both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus&#39;d. prince. then say it once what thou dost know in this. friar. i will be brief, for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale. romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet; and she, there dead, that romeo&#39;s faithful wife. i married them; and their stol&#39;n marriage day was tybalt&#39;s doomsday, whose untimely death banish&#39;d the new-made bridegroom from this city; for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin&#39;d. you, to remove that siege of grief from her, betroth&#39;d and would have married her perforce to county paris. then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage, or in my cell there would she kill herself. then gave i her (so tutored by my art) a sleeping potion; which so took effect as i intended, for it wrought on her the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave, being the time the potion&#39;s force should cease. but he which bore my letter, friar john, was stay&#39;d by accident, and yesternight return&#39;d my letter back. then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred&#39;s vault; meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo. but when i came, some minute ere the time of her awaking, here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead. she wakes; and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience; but then a noise did scare me from the tomb, and she, too desperate, would not go with me, but, as it seems, did violence on herself. all this i know, and to the marriage her nurse is privy; and if aught in this miscarried by my fault, let my old life be sacrific&#39;d, some hour before his time, unto the rigour of severest law. prince. we still have known thee for a holy man. where&#39;s romeo&#39;s man? what can he say in this? bal. i brought my master news of juliet&#39;s death; and then in post he came from mantua to this same place, to this same monument. this letter he early bid me give his father, and threat&#39;ned me with death, going in the vault, if i departed not and left him there. prince. give me the letter. i will look on it. where is the county&#39;s page that rais&#39;d the watch? sirrah, what made your master in this place? boy. he came with flowers to strew his lady&#39;s grave; and bid me stand aloof, and so i did. anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; and by-and-by my master drew on him; and then i ran away to call the watch. prince. this letter doth make good the friar&#39;s words, their course of love, the tidings of her death; and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary, and therewithal came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet. where be these enemies? capulet, montage, see what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! and i, for winking at you, discords too, have lost a brace of kinsmen. all are punish&#39;d. cap. o brother montague, give me thy hand. this is my daughter&#39;s jointure, for no more can i demand. mon. but i can give thee more; for i will raise her statue in pure gold, that whiles verona by that name is known, there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet. cap. as rich shall romeo&#39;s by his lady&#39;s lie- poor sacrifices of our enmity! prince. a glooming peace this morning with it brings. the sun for sorrow will not show his head. go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; some shall be pardon&#39;d, and some punished; for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo. exeunt omnes. the end

tedious tale  romeo  there dead  was husband to that juliet  and she  there dead  that romeo s faithful wife  i married them  and their stol n marriage day was tybalt s doomsday  whose untimely death banish d the new made bridegroom from this city  for whom  and not for tybalt  juliet pin d  you  to remove that siege of grief from her  betroth d and would have married her perforce to county paris  then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage  or in my cell there would she kill herself  then gave i her  so tutored by my art  a sleeping potion  which so took effect as i intended  for it wrought on her the form of death  meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave  being the time the potion s force should cease  but he which bore my letter  friar john  was stay d by accident  and yesternight return d my letter back  then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred s vault  meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo  but when i came  some minute ere the time of her awaking  here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead  she wakes  and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience  but then a noise did scare me from the tomb  and she  too desperate  would not go with me  but  as it seems  did violence on herself  all this i know  and to the marriage her nurse is privy  and if aught in this miscarried by my fault  let my old life be sacrific d  some hour before his time  unto the rigour of severest law  prince  we still have known thee for a holy man  where s romeo s man  what can he say in this  bal  i brought my master news of juliet s death  and then in post he came from mantua to this same place  to this same monument  this letter he early bid me give his father  and threat ned me with death  going in the vault  if i departed not and left him there  prince  give me the letter  i will look on it  where is the county s page that rais d the watch  sirrah  what made your master in this place  boy  he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave  and bid me stand aloof  and so i did  anon comes one with light to ope the tomb  and by and by my master drew on him  and then i ran away to call the watch  prince  this letter doth make good the friar s words  their course of love  the tidings of her death  and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary  and therewithal came to this vault to die  and lie with juliet  where be these enemies  capulet  montage  see what a scourge is laid upon your hate  that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love  and i  for winking at you  discords too  have

sacrifices of our enmity  prince  a glooming peace this morning with it brings  the sun for sorrow will not show his head  go hence  to have more talk of these sad things  some shall be pardon d  and some punished  for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo  exeunt omnes  the end

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len()</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#using-len" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(len(text))</span></code> to print the <strong>number of characters</strong> in the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> </code>, including letters, spaces, and any remaining symbols.
For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(text)</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">11</span></code> (5 letters + 1 space + 5 letters).
This is useful for checking the length of the entire string, but it doesn’t tell you how many words there are.</p>
<p>We can also use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(len(text.split()))</span></code> to print the <strong>number of words</strong> in the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.split()</span></code> breaks the string into a list of words using whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) as the default separator.
For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world&quot;</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.split()</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;hello&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;world&quot;]</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(text.split())</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>.
This is commonly used in text analysis to count how many words are in a document or sentence.</p>

<h2>Tokenizing<a class="headerlink" href="#tokenizing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This line of code breaks the input text into individual tokens, which are typically words and punctuation marks. First, the text is converted to lowercase using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.lower()</span></code> to ensure consistency in analysis. Then, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word_tokenize()</span></code> function from NLTK is used to intelligently split the text into a list of tokens, accounting for punctuation, contractions, and special characters. The resulting tokens are stored in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">token</span></code>, making them ready for further processing such as frequency analysis or filtering.</p>

<p>This code removes common stopwords from the list of tokens in the text. It first imports the list of English stopwords from the NLTK corpus and stores them as a set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> for faster lookup. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code> containing only the tokens that are <strong>not</strong> in the stopwords set. Finally, it prints the cleaned list of tokens, which now excludes common words like “the”, “is”, and “and”—helping to focus analysis on more meaningful content.</p>

After printing the top words, the code separates this list of word-frequency pairs into two separate lists: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> holds the words and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> holds their corresponding frequencies.

<p>The command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span> <span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code> is used in environments like Jupyter Notebook to install the <strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code></strong> library.</p>
<p>This library allows you to generate <strong>word clouds</strong>, which are visual representations of text data where more frequent words appear larger and bolder. The exclamation mark <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span></code> at the beginning tells the notebook to run the command as a shell command, just like you would in a terminal. After installation, you can use the library to easily create word clouds from token lists, frequency distributions, or raw text.</p>

<p>This code generates and displays a <strong>word cloud</strong> from the list of meaningful tokens stored in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code>.</p>
<p>It starts by importing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WordCloud</span></code> and other useful tools from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code> library. A figure is created using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.figure()</span></code> with a size of 12x12 inches. The word cloud is then generated with specified dimensions (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">width=1800</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">height=1400</span></code>) by converting the list of tokens (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code>) into a single string using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str(no_stopwords)</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.imshow()</span></code> function displays the word cloud image, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.axis(&quot;off&quot;)</span></code> removes the axis for a cleaner look. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.show()</span></code> renders the visual, where the size of each word reflects its frequency in the text.</p>

<p>This code snippet uses spaCy to identify and extract names and locations from a given text. It begins by loading the small English language model with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spacy.load(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;)</span></code>, then processes the input <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nlp(text)</span></code> to create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Doc</span></code> object. The code then iterates over the named entities found in the text and filters them to include only those labeled as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;PERSON&quot;</span></code> (people’s names), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;GPE&quot;</span></code> (geopolitical entities like cities or countries), and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;LOC&quot;</span></code> (non-political locations like mountains or rivers). For each matching entity, it prints the text and the corresponding label, helping users focus specifically on identifying individuals and places mentioned in the content.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#sentiment-analysis" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code sets up the environment for performing sentiment analysis using both <strong>VADER</strong> (from NLTK) and <strong>TextBlob</strong>.</p>
<p>The first two lines install the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">textblob</span></code> libraries using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%pip</span></code> magic command (used in environments like Jupyter Notebooks). Then, the script imports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SentimentIntensityAnalyzer</span></code> from NLTK, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TextBlob</span></code> for another method of sentiment analysis, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> for data handling.</p>
<p>Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nltk.download(&quot;vader_lexicon&quot;)</span></code> ensures that the necessary VADER sentiment dictionary is downloaded, which is essential for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SentimentIntensityAnalyzer</span></code> to function correctly. This setup allows you to analyze sentiment using two different tools for comparison or deeper insight.</p>

Each sentence is passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">polarity_scores()</span></code>, which returns sentiment metrics: compound (overall sentiment score), and the proportions of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. These results are stored in a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a sentence and its corresponding sentiment scores. The script then prints some of sentences analyzed and iteratively displays the sentiment scores for each one, showing the beginning of each sentence for readability if it’s longer than 50 characters.</p>

<p>This code combines two sentiment analysis approaches—<strong>VADER</strong> and <strong>TextBlob</strong>—to provide both detailed and overall sentiment insights. First, it creates a <strong>Pandas DataFrame</strong> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sentiment_df</span></code>) from the previously generated list of sentiment scores, making it easier to analyze or visualize the results. Then, it uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TextBlob</span></code> to calculate the <strong>overall polarity</strong> and <strong>subjectivity</strong> of the entire text. Polarity ranges from -1 to 1 (negative to positive sentiment), while subjectivity ranges from 0 to 1 (objective to subjective language). The results are printed with brief explanations to help interpret the sentiment values.</p>
