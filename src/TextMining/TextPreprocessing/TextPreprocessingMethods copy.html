<p>This code block sets up the tools needed for basic text processing and analysis. It imports the NLTK library for natural language processing, Python’s built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code> module for handling punctuation, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib.pyplot</span></code> for creating visualizations. It also downloads two essential NLTK resources: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">punkt_tab</span></code> for advanced word tokenization and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stopwords</span></code> for filtering out common words that usually don’t carry meaningful information. Finally, it imports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word_tokenize</span></code> to split text into individual words and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FreqDist</span></code> to calculate the frequency of those words for further analysis or visualization.</p>

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.lower()</span></code> to make text uniform<a class="headerlink" href="#using-lower-to-make-text-uniform" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code is using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.lower()</span></code> to convert all characters in the text to lowercase, which is a common step in text preprocessing to ensure consistency (so that words like “This” and “this” are treated the same). Similarly, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.upper()</span></code> method converts all characters to uppercase. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(text)</span></code> outputs the lowercase version of the text.</p>

<p>This code defines a function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read_book(title)</span></code> that reads the full contents of a text file and returns it as a single cleaned-up string.</p>
<p>Inside the function, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">open(...)</span></code> statement opens the file specified by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code> in read mode with UTF-8 encoding, ensuring it can handle most characters properly. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read()</span></code> method loads the entire file content into the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code>. The line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.replace(&quot;\n&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&quot;).replace(&quot;\r&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&quot;)</span></code> removes newline and carriage return characters, flattening the text into a continuous string.</p>
<p>After defining the function, the line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">read_book(&quot;RomeoAndJuliet.txt&quot;)</span></code> calls it to load the contents of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. The following line, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">text.lower()</span></code>, converts the entire text to lowercase. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(text)</span></code> displays the cleaned, lowercase version of the text.</p>

   speak, nephew, were you by when it began?  ben. here were the servants of your adversary    and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.    i drew to part them. in the instant came    the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar&#39;d;    which, as he breath&#39;d defiance to my ears,    he swung about his head and cut the winds,    who, nothing hurt withal, hiss&#39;d him in scorn.    while we were interchanging thrusts and blows,    came more and more, and fought on part and part,    till the prince came, who parted either part.  m. wife. o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day?    right glad i am he was not at this fray.  ben. madam, an hour before the worshipp&#39;d sun    peer&#39;d forth the golden window of the east,    a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;    where, underneath the grove of sycamore    that westward rooteth from the city&#39;s side,    so early walking did i see your son.    towards him i made; but he was ware of me    and stole into the covert of the wood.    i- measuring his affections by my own,    which then most sought where most might not be found,    being one too many by my weary self-    pursu&#39;d my humour, not pursuing his,    and gladly shunn&#39;d who gladly fled from me.  mon. many a morning hath he there been seen,    with tears augmenting the fresh morning&#39;s dew,    adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;    but all so soon as the all-cheering sun    should in the furthest east bean to draw    the shady curtains from aurora&#39;s bed,    away from light steals home my heavy son    and private in his chamber pens himself,    shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight    and makes himself an artificial night.    black and portentous must this humour prove    unless good counsel may the cause remove.  ben. my noble uncle, do you know the cause?  mon. i neither know it nor can learn of him  ben. have you importun&#39;d him by any means?  mon. both by myself and many other friend;    but he, his own affections&#39; counsellor,    is to himself- i will not say how true-    but to himself so secret and so close,    so far from sounding and discovery,    as is the bud bit with an envious worm    ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air    or dedicate his beauty to the sun.    could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,    we would as willingly give cure as know.                       enter romeo.  ben. see, where he comes. so please you step aside,    i&#39;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.  mon. i would thou wert so happy by thy stay    to hear true shrift. come, madam, let&#39;s away,                                     exeunt [montague and wife].  ben. good morrow, cousin.  rom. is the day so young?  ben. but new struck nine.  rom. ay me! sad hours seem long.    was that my father that went hence so fast?  ben. it was. what sadness lengthens romeo&#39;s hours?  rom. not having that which having makes them short.  ben. in love?  rom. out-  ben. of love?  rom. out of her favour where i am in love.  ben. alas that love, so gentle in his view,    should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!  rom. alas that love, whose view is muffled still,    should without eyes see pathways to his will!    where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here?    yet tell me not, for i have heard it all.    here&#39;s much to do with hate, but more with love.    why then, o brawling love! o loving hate!    o anything, of nothing first create!    o heavy lightness! serious vanity!    misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!    feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!    still-waking sleep, that is not what it is    this love feel i, that feel no love in this.    dost thou not laugh?  ben. no, coz, i rather weep.  rom. good heart, at what?  ben. at thy good heart&#39;s oppression.  rom. why, such is love&#39;s transgression.    griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,    which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest    with more of thine. this love that thou hast shown    doth add more grief to too much of mine own.    love is a smoke rais&#39;d with the fume of sighs;    being purg&#39;d, a fire sparkling in lovers&#39; eyes;    being vex&#39;d, a sea nourish&#39;d with lovers&#39; tears.    what is it else? a madness most discreet,    a choking gall, and a preserving sweet.    farewell, my coz.  ben. soft! i will go along.    an if you leave me so, you do me wrong.  rom. tut! i have lost myself; i am not here:    this is not romeo, he&#39;s some other where.  ben. tell me in sadness, who is that you love?  rom. what, shall i groan and tell thee?  ben. groan? why, no;    but sadly tell me who.  rom. bid a sick man in sadness make his will.    ah, word ill urg&#39;d to one that is so ill!    in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.  ben. i aim&#39;d so near when i suppos&#39;d you lov&#39;d.  rom. a right good markman! and she&#39;s fair i love.  ben. a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.  rom. well, in that hit you miss. she&#39;ll not be hit    with cupid&#39;s arrow. she hath dian&#39;s wit,    and, in strong proof of chastity well arm&#39;d,    from love&#39;s weak childish bow she lives unharm&#39;d.    she will not stay the siege of loving terms,    nor bide th&#39; encounter of assailing eyes,    nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.    o, she&#39;s rich in beauty; only poor    that, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.  ben. then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?  rom. she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;    for beauty, starv&#39;d with her severity,    cuts beauty off from all posterity.    she is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,    to merit bliss by making me despair.    she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow    do i live dead that live to tell it now.  ben. be rul&#39;d by me: forget to think of her.  rom. o, teach me how i should forget to think!  ben. by giving liberty unto thine eyes.    examine other beauties.  rom. &#39;tis the way    to call hers (exquisite) in question more.    these happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#39; brows,    being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.    he that is strucken blind cannot forget    the precious treasure of his eyesight lost.    show me a mistress that is passing fair,    what doth her beauty serve but as a note    where i may read who pass&#39;d that passing fair?

warm and new kill&#39;d.  prince. search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.  chief watch. here is a friar, and slaughter&#39;d romeo&#39;s man,    with instruments upon them fit to open    these dead men&#39;s tombs.  cap. o heavens! o wife, look how our daughter bleeds!    this dagger hath mista&#39;en, for, lo, his house    is empty on the back of montague,    and it missheathed in my daughter&#39;s bosom!  wife. o me! this sight of death is as a bell    that warns my old age to a sepulchre.               enter montague [and others].  prince. come, montague; for thou art early up    to see thy son and heir more early down.  mon. alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!    grief of my son&#39;s exile hath stopp&#39;d her breath.    what further woe conspires against mine age?  prince. look, and thou shalt see.  mon. o thou untaught! what manners is in this,    to press before thy father to a grave?  prince. seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,    till we can clear these ambiguities    and know their spring, their head, their true descent;    and then will i be general of your woes    and lead you even to death. meantime forbear,    and let mischance be slave to patience.    bring forth the parties of suspicion.  friar. i am the greatest, able to do least,    yet most suspected, as the time and place    doth make against me, of this direful murther;    and here i stand, both to impeach and purge    myself condemned and myself excus&#39;d.  prince. then say it once what thou dost know in this.  friar. i will be brief, for my short date of breath    is not so long as is a tedious tale.    romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet;    and she, there dead, that romeo&#39;s faithful wife.    i married them; and their stol&#39;n marriage day    was tybalt&#39;s doomsday, whose untimely death    banish&#39;d the new-made bridegroom from this city;    for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin&#39;d.    you, to remove that siege of grief from her,    betroth&#39;d and would have married her perforce    to county paris. then comes she to me    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean    to rid her from this second marriage,    or in my cell there would she kill herself.    then gave i her (so tutored by my art)    a sleeping potion; which so took effect    as i intended, for it wrought on her    the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo    that he should hither come as this dire night    to help to take her from her borrowed grave,    being the time the potion&#39;s force should cease.    but he which bore my letter, friar john,    was stay&#39;d by accident, and yesternight    return&#39;d my letter back. then all alone    at the prefixed hour of her waking    came i to take her from her kindred&#39;s vault;    meaning to keep her closely at my cell    till i conveniently could send to romeo.    but when i came, some minute ere the time    of her awaking, here untimely lay    the noble paris and true romeo dead.    she wakes; and i entreated her come forth    and bear this work of heaven with patience;    but then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    and she, too desperate, would not go with me,    but, as it seems, did violence on herself.    all this i know, and to the marriage    her nurse is privy; and if aught in this    miscarried by my fault, let my old life    be sacrific&#39;d, some hour before his time,    unto the rigour of severest law.  prince. we still have known thee for a holy man.    where&#39;s romeo&#39;s man? what can he say in this?  bal. i brought my master news of juliet&#39;s death;    and then in post he came from mantua    to this same place, to this same monument.    this letter he early bid me give his father,    and threat&#39;ned me with death, going in the vault,    if i departed not and left him there.  prince. give me the letter. i will look on it.    where is the county&#39;s page that rais&#39;d the watch?    sirrah, what made your master in this place?  boy. he came with flowers to strew his lady&#39;s grave;    and bid me stand aloof, and so i did.    anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;    and by-and-by my master drew on him;    and then i ran away to call the watch.  prince. this letter doth make good the friar&#39;s words,    their course of love, the tidings of her death;    and here he writes that he did buy a poison    of a poor pothecary, and therewithal    came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet.    where be these enemies? capulet, montage,    see what a scourge is laid upon your hate,    that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!    and i, for winking at you, discords too,    have lost a brace of kinsmen. all are punish&#39;d.  cap. o brother montague, give me thy hand.    this is my daughter&#39;s jointure, for no more    can i demand.  mon. but i can give thee more;    for i will raise her statue in pure gold,    that whiles verona by that name is known,    there shall no figure at such rate be set    as that of true and faithful juliet.  cap. as rich shall romeo&#39;s by his lady&#39;s lie-    poor sacrifices of our enmity!  prince. a glooming peace this morning with it brings.    the sun for sorrow will not show his head.    go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;    some shall be pardon&#39;d, and some punished;    for never was a story of more woe    than this of juliet and her romeo.                                                   exeunt omnes.the endend of the project gutenberg ebook of romeo and juliet, by william shakespeare*** end of this project gutenberg

siege of grief from her     betroth d and would have married her perforce    to county paris  then comes she to me    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean    to rid her from this second marriage     or in my cell there would she kill herself     then gave i her  so tutored by my art     a sleeping potion  which so took effect    as i intended  for it wrought on her    the form of death  meantime i writ to romeo    that he should hither come as this dire night    to help to take her from her borrowed grave     being the time the potion s force should cease     but he which bore my letter  friar john     was stay d by accident  and yesternight    return d my letter back  then all alone    at the prefixed hour of her waking    came i to take her from her kindred s vault     meaning to keep her closely at my cell    till i conveniently could send to romeo     but when i came  some minute ere the time    of her awaking  here untimely lay    the noble paris and true romeo dead     she wakes  and i entreated her come forth    and bear this work of heaven with patience     but then a noise did scare me from the tomb     and she  too desperate  would not go with me

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len()</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#using-len" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(len(text))</span></code> to print the <strong>number of characters</strong> in the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> </code>, including letters, spaces, and any remaining symbols.
For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(text)</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">11</span></code> (5 letters + 1 space + 5 letters).
This is useful for checking the length of the entire string, but it doesn’t tell you how many words there are.</p>
<p>We can also use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(len(text.split()))</span></code> to print the <strong>number of words</strong> in the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.split()</span></code> breaks the string into a list of words using whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks) as the default separator.
For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;hello</span> <span class="pre">world&quot;</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.split()</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;hello&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;world&quot;]</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(text.split())</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>.
This is commonly used in text analysis to count how many words are in a document or sentence.</p>

<h2>Tokenizing<a class="headerlink" href="#tokenizing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This line of code breaks the input text into individual tokens, which are typically words and punctuation marks. First, the text is converted to lowercase using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text.lower()</span></code> to ensure consistency in analysis. Then, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word_tokenize()</span></code> function from NLTK is used to intelligently split the text into a list of tokens, accounting for punctuation, contractions, and special characters. The resulting tokens are stored in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">token</span></code>, making them ready for further processing such as frequency analysis or filtering.</p>

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stopwords</span></code> to remove stop words<a class="headerlink" href="#using-stopwords-to-remove-stop-words" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code removes common stopwords from the list of tokens in the text. It first imports the list of English stopwords from the NLTK corpus and stores them as a set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> for faster lookup. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code> containing only the tokens that are <strong>not</strong> in the stopwords set. Finally, it prints the cleaned list of tokens, which now excludes common words like “the”, “is”, and “and”—helping to focus analysis on more meaningful content.</p>

<p>The line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len(no_stopwords)</span></code> returns the <strong>number of tokens remaining after stopwords have been removed</strong> from the original text.</p>
<p>This is useful for understanding how much of the text consists of meaningful or content-rich words (i.e., words that aren’t basic connectors like <em>“and”</em>, <em>“the”</em>, or <em>“is”</em>). The result gives you a clearer sense of the size of your cleaned, analysis-ready dataset.</p>

<h2>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FreqDist</span></code> to Get Frequencies<a class="headerlink" href="#using-freqdist-to-get-frequencies" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code calculates and displays the frequency of the most common words in the cleaned text. First, it creates a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FreqDist</span></code> object from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code> list, which counts how often each token appears. Then, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fdist.most_common(5)</span></code> returns the top 5 most frequent words along with their counts, and this result is stored in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fdist1</span></code>. After printing the top words, the code separates this list of word-frequency pairs into two separate lists: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> holds the words and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> holds their corresponding frequencies. This separation is useful for plotting or further analysis.</p>

<p>The line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.bar(x,</span> <span class="pre">y)</span></code> creates a <strong>bar chart</strong> using the two lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> contains the <strong>words</strong> (labels for the x-axis), and</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> contains the <strong>frequencies</strong> (heights of the bars on the y-axis).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This visualizes the top 5 most common words (after removing stopwords) and shows how frequently each one appears in the text. It’s a helpful way to quickly identify which meaningful words are most prominent.</p>

<p>This code calculates the frequency of all tokens in the text, including common stopwords and punctuation (if not previously removed).</p>
<p>First, it uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FreqDist(token)</span></code> to create a frequency distribution object that counts how many times each token appears. Then, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fdist.most_common(5)</span></code> retrieves the top 5 most frequent tokens along with their counts, and prints them. Next, it separates this list of (word, frequency) pairs into two separate lists: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> contains the top 10 words, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> contains their corresponding frequencies.

<p>The command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span> <span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code> is used in environments like Jupyter Notebook to install the <strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code></strong> library.</p>
<p>This library allows you to generate <strong>word clouds</strong>, which are visual representations of text data where more frequent words appear larger and bolder. The exclamation mark <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!</span></code> at the beginning tells the notebook to run the command as a shell command, just like you would in a terminal. After installation, you can use the library to easily create word clouds from token lists, frequency distributions, or raw text.</p>

<p>This code generates and displays a <strong>word cloud</strong> from the list of meaningful tokens stored in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code>.</p>
<p>It starts by importing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WordCloud</span></code> and other useful tools from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wordcloud</span></code> library. A figure is created using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.figure()</span></code> with a size of 12x12 inches. The word cloud is then generated with specified dimensions (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">width=1800</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">height=1400</span></code>) by converting the list of tokens (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_stopwords</span></code>) into a single string using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str(no_stopwords)</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.imshow()</span></code> function displays the word cloud image, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.axis(&quot;off&quot;)</span></code> removes the axis for a cleaner look. Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.show()</span></code> renders the visual, where the size of each word reflects its frequency in the text.</p>
