# Wolfe Notebooks
These Wolfe Notebooks offer a hands-on introduction to essential Python skills in data visualization and analysis. Each notebook is an interactive guide that combines live code with clear explanations, making it easy to learn by doing. The **Bar Charts**, **Line Charts**, and **Scatter Plots** notebooks teach you how to create and customize visualizations to explore patterns and trends in data. The **Basic Mapping Skills with Python** notebook introduces you to geographic data visualization using libraries like `geopandas`. Finally, the **Introduction to Text Analysis in Python** introduces key natural language processing techniques in Python, such as tokenization, stopword removal, frequency distribution analysis, stemming, and lemmatization, to help you break down, clean, and analyze text data efficiently for further NLP and machine learning applications.
