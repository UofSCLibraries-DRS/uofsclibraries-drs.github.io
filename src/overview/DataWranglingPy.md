# Data Wrangling with Python

## Basic Python Tutorials
These five basic Python tutorials teach the fundamentals of Python programming, starting with operators, expressions, data types, and variables. They then cover flow control (like if-else statements and loops), data structures such as lists and dictionaries, and how to write and use your own functions. The series concludes with an introduction to working with strings and using popular Python packages—equipping learners with the essential tools to begin text analysis in Python.

## Intermediate Python Tutorials
These intermediate Python tutorials build on the basics by introducing more advanced concepts and tools. They cover comprehensions for lists, dictionaries, and sets; working with different file types (like .txt, .csv, .json); using the pathlib library for file manipulation; and the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including how to define and use classes. The series concludes with an explanation of generators, their syntax, and the benefits of using them for efficient data processing.

## Pandas Python Tutorials
The Basic Pandas tutorials teach how to work with tabular data using Python, similar to working with spreadsheets but with more powerful tools for data analysis. The series begins with creating and exploring DataFrames, then moves on to filtering, handling missing data, indexing, and sorting. It concludes with advanced techniques like merging DataFrames, removing duplicates, performing vectorized operations, and applying custom functions to data.  

The intermediate Pandas tutorials focus on optimizing performance and enhancing data analysis and visualization. They cover using the PyArrow backend for faster processing, grouping and aggregating data, and creating pivot tables. The series also includes working with time series data, generating static plots with .plot(), and building interactive charts with Plotly—demonstrating the full data workflow from cleaning to visualization.
