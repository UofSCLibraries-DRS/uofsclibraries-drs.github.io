# Brief Overview
Data visualization is the practice of representing data graphically to better understand trends, patterns, and insights. The University of South Carolina Libraries offer a variety of data visualization resources, including guides on visualization tools and techniques, and help with selecting the most effective methods for specific needs. Students, faculty, and staff can access consultations, attend workshops, and use the DataLab space on the 5th floor of Thomas Cooper Library. These resources support learning and application of tools such as Excel, Tableau, and R for effective data analysis and presentation.
