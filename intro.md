# Introduction

Welcome to the [Data Research Services (DRS)](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/digital_research_services/) at the University of South Carolina Libraries Lab Notebooks! These notebooks support many stages of the research process, including data management, analysis, visualization. DRS aims to lower technological barriers, making modern research tools more accessible and effective. Hence, this repository is set up to share notebooks, code, and tutorials that can help a researcher get started with a new tool wherever they are with their research and skills.
