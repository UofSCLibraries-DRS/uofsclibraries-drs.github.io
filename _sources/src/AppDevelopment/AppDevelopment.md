# Getting Started with App Development with Python

This project consists of a React Native frontend and a FastAPI backend designed to provide a seamless unit conversion experience across multiple categories like length, weight, cooking, and temperature. The frontend leverages Expo for easy development and deployment on mobile devices, while the backend uses FastAPI for fast, reliable API handling and scalability. Together, these technologies create a responsive and user-friendly app that simplifies everyday conversions. Below are detailed guides for running the app locally, deploying the backend with Render, and building the mobile app with Expoâ€™s EAS build system. Explore the linked folders to dive into the code, deployment instructions, and start contributing or customizing the app for your own needs.
