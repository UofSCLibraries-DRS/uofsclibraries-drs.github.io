# MultiLingual NER
This three-part series on Named Entity Recognition (NER) introduces the challenges and techniques for working with multilingual texts. It begins by explaining NER concepts, text encoding, and the difficulties of processing multilingual corpora. The following lessons cover rule-based NER using spaCy, including creating an EntityRuler and language identification, and conclude with an introduction to word embeddings, machine learning, and implementing supervised NER using spaCy 3.
