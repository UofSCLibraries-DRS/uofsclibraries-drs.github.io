# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the practice of representing data graphically to better understand trends, patterns, and insights. The University of South Carolina Libraries offer a variety of data visualization resources, including guides on visualization tools and techniques, and help with selecting the most effective methods for specific needs. Students, faculty, and staff can [request consultations and attend workshops](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/get_research_help/data_services/data_visualization_gis/index.php) to improve their data visualizations. These resources support learning and application of tools such as Excel, Tableau, and R for effective data analysis and presentation.

## Matplotlib
This guide introduces several types of data visualizations—bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps—and explains how to create them using Python libraries. Bar charts and line charts are ideal for comparing categories or showing trends over time, while scatter plots help reveal relationships between two variables. Maps, particularly choropleth and proportional dot maps, are used to visualize geographic or spatial data. The tutorial primarily uses **Matplotlib** for charting due to its simplicity. **Numpy** and **Pandas** are used to efficiently manage and manipulate data, while **Geopandas** is introduced for working with spatial data formats like Shapefiles and GeoJSON.

## Seaborn
This section introduces **Seaborn**, a Python library for creating statistical visualizations. Built on **matplotlib** and integrated with **pandas**, Seaborn makes it easy to explore and visualize relationships in data with minimal code. It provides smart defaults, customizable features, and is well-suited for both quick exploration and presentation-ready plots.
