# R

## Classification
This tutorial walks you through a basic machine learning workflow in R using the Iris dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets. After scaling features, a Random Forest classifier is trained and evaluated using a confusion matrix. This notebook provides a clear, step-by-step introduction to classification with R.
