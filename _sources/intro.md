# Introduction

Welcome to the University of South Carolina Libraries [Data Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/find_services/digital_research_services/) Lab Notebooks! These notebooks support many stages of the research process, including data management, analysis, visualization. DRS aims to lower technological barriers, making modern research tools more accessible and effective. Hence, this repository is set up to share notebooks, code, and tutorials that can help a researcher get started with a new tool wherever they are with their research and skills.

## Acknowledgements
This is a compilation of notebooks from several people. Big thank you to Ithaka, Constellate,  and JSTOR Labs Team, Nathan Kelber and Ted Lawless for writing many of these notebooks.  Also, thank you to William Mattingly from the TAP Institute Patrick Wolfe, ISchool Intern from Spring 2022 

## What are Jupyter Notebooks?

Project Jupyter is an open-source platform comprising standards, a community, and tools, with Jupyter Notebook allowing users to combine code, data, equations, and narrative text in a single interactive document. These notebooks are especially effective for learning Python, providing a hands-on environment where students can write, run, and debug code alongside explanations and visualizations. Jupyter enhances education across disciplines—from STEM and social sciences to writing and digital humanities—by enabling computational storytelling and interactive exploration. Teachers benefit from improved efficiency and reduced cognitive load, while students gain practical experience with programming, problem-solving, and communication. The platform also supports building simulations, using interactive widgets, and creating visualizations to deepen understanding and engagement.

## What are Constellate Notebooks?

Constellate Notebooks are interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to support text analysis using Constellate’s datasets of scholarly and historical texts. They provide structured, hands-on lessons that guide users through analyzing metadata, counting words, creating visualizations, and applying natural language processing techniques. These notebooks are beginner-friendly and ideal for teaching Python programming and digital humanities methods in an accessible, reproducible format. Each notebook includes annotated code, explanatory text, and interactive elements that help users learn both technical and conceptual skills. Constellate Notebooks are valuable tools for students, educators, and researchers exploring computational text analysis.
